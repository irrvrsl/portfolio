description: This is my personal portfolio site. I used all new technologies in frontend development, that i know. Site is done in material design, but with some difference. I used here a materializecss framework for the frontend, Hugo static site generator as the platform. Bunch of SVG animations(with GSAP), css3 transitions and all that modern stuff.
