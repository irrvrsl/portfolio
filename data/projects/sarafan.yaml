description: This project was not so hard as i supposed, because it's just a static promo-website. In this project i used a new technologies in frontend-development such as Flexbox layout, SVG graphic and CSS3. And it was not done, because my employeer sold out his boutique. But u can check it out on development stage at divshot, link in the table above.
